# Name shown in the "Actions" tab

# We can write the events in two ways
# on:

#   workflow_dispatch:
on: [push, workflow_dispatch]

# ❓ can I have an action without jobs?
# 💡 no. a job is required and it must have steps. else it throws an error.

# ❓ can I call my job anything or is there a requirement?
# 💡 yes. it's displayed in the single action screen, eg. https://github.com/ekafyi/hello-gh-actions/actions/runs/836142989
